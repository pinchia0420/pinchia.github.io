      <ol>
        <li>Run through each page with the WAVE Chrome Extension:
	No, there are links contain no text.
        </li>
        <li>Users should be able to navigate through content using their keyboard:
	Yes
        </li>
        <li>Users should be able to navigate content using a screen reader:
	Yes
        </li>
        <li>The general architecture and hierarchy of the content should make sense:
	Yes
        </li>
        <li>Charts and images should all have alt-text so that users with screen readers or users on a slow connection will still be able to understand the images:
	Yes
        </li>
        <li>Decorative images should not be visible to screen readers:
	Yes
        </li>
      </ol>

    <h3>
      <p>1. Instead of placing background images for a link, add an image tag within an image link.</p>
      <p>2. Footer should use <footer> tag instead of placing it inside of body with div tag.</p>
      <p>3. The search icon is placed a little far from the input for searching. I would recommend to place it next to the input area.</p>
      <p>4. File structure could be better organized. For example, images should be placed in image file, .css files should be placed in css file, and etc.</p>
